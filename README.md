## Motivation

> Aside from a bulky PDF document, Viome does not allow users to export data. I reached out to customer support and they let me know that there are no plans to allow exporting to CSV or other formats. The mobile app requires me to login every single time I open it.

## Taking Control of My Data

> I wanted my recommendations in a simple table. So I intercepted some API traffic, checked the queries, and used Python to generate HTML and CSV recommendation files.

## Directions

> 1. Download this .zip
> 2. Two options to run:
>       - Put your Viome credentials into config.py
>       - Run directly from the command line
> 3. Status: [SUCCESS] console output indicates the tool ran successfully.
